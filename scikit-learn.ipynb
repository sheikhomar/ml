    "- `estimator.predict(T)` predicts target features for a new set of data `T`. Some estimators also provide the `estimator.predict_proba()` method. This method returns the probability of an instance being in each of our target values.\n",
    "- `estimator.score()` provides a standard way to evaluate the model that is created by the estimator. The method returns a value from 0 to 1\n",
    "- `estimator.transform(X_new)` transforms new data into the new basis and applies this transformation model to unseen data.\n",
    "- `estimator.fit_transform()` may be more convenient and efficient for modelling and transforming the training data simultaneously."

    " 2. Once the model is trained, we can predict any target feature on our test data using the `estimator.predict(T)` method.\n",
    " 3. In this step, we evaluate our model by comparing the predictions to the correct values. The evaluation method depends on the algorithm that we have employed."
